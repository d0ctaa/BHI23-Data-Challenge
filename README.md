# BHI23-Data-Challenge

Goal of Challenge:

Predict the 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases and that of the positivity rate based on the historical public health data.
Report : predictions for the 1-week prediction period (Sep. 27, 2021 – Oct. 4, 2021)

Daily new cases for the 1-week prediction period
7-day average of daily new cases for every 7-day window ending on each day of the 1-week prediction period
Daily positivity rate for the 1-week prediction period
7-day average of the positivity rate for every 7-day window ending on each day of the 1-week prediction period Along with these future predictions
report how accurately trained models were able to fit the historical data for the 4-week period ending on the submission date (Aug. 30, 2021 – Sep. 26, 2021).
Evaluation :

How accurately is the predictive model able to model the trends in the past?
How accurately can the model predict future trends for the next 1-week period?
